## About
A collection of practice problems that I did using OR-Tools. The difficulty is supposed to ramp up somewhat in this manner:

Intro
1. N-Queens
2. Sudoku
3. Graph Coloring

Basic
1. Knapsack
2. Bin packing

Intermediate
1. Single Machine Scheduling
2. RCPSP lite

Intermediate+
1. SALBP-1
2. SALBP-2

Each problem introduces a new concept/tool in OR-Tools, so its best to do them in order. At least that's what it felt like to me.

## How to run
0. `uv sync`
1. `uv run src/n_queens.py`
